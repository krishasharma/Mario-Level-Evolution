# MarioLevelEvolution

This project involves generating playable and interesting Super Mario Bros. levels using a genetic algorithm. The evolutionary approach explores two different encodings of Mario levels and applies selection, crossover, mutation, and fitness evaluation to create levels with diverse gameplay.

## Introduction

In this project, you will:
- Implement a genetic algorithm to evolve Super Mario Bros. levels.
- Explore two encodings of levels: a grid-based encoding and a design element-based encoding.
- Experiment with selection, crossover, mutation, and fitness functions to create fun, playable levels.
- Play and evaluate levels created by the algorithm.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Unity 3D (to run the Mario simulator)
- Python packages: `numpy`, `scipy`
